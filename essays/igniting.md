<h1>E1: UI Basics Technical Essay</h1>
</head>


BrowserHistory1 was very similar to the lab that we had worked on previously in class. This made it much easier for me to comprehend what was being asked because I had already done it before. This WOD was more time consuming because it had many steps, such as making multiple headers and linking them to external web pages. The thing that I had trouble with was creating the table of contents. Creating an itemized list for the sections was something foreign to me, so I had to watch the screencast for that. BrowserHistory2 was more confusing because the entire thing was something new. After reading the instructions and trying a little, I kept on getting stuck and having to restart. I had to go back to our readings about google fonts because I couldnâ€™t figure out how we were supposed to get it to Open Sans. When I tried to autofill it in VSCode it kept defaulting to Sans Serif, so I just assumed that they are the same. After watching the screencast things became clearer, but I will have to review BrowserHistory2 when we start working on similar assignments. BrowserHistory3 was very abstract, I knew what was expected from the image, but not how I was going to get there. I had to watch the screencast very early on and even after watching it, it still took many tries to get the result I wanted. I found that you could skip the list-style-type step by putting the display inline after trying it a few times. I am not 100% sure how that works, but it did. After completing all three assignments, I have a better understanding of what we are expected to know for our future assignments, but I will definitely not be able to recite this information off the top of my head without more practice.
