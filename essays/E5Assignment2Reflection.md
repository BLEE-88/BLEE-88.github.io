<body>
Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
<p>Assignment 2 was about being able to create user login and registrations so that user information could be stored on the server. We would also have to be able to pass order information through the login and registration to an invoice. Some people had different independent requirements, but mine was IR5 which was a little bit confusing to me, so I was not able to get it done.</p>
<div>
What did you learn from this assignment?
<p>I learned how to create login forms that could save user information onto a server so that they would not have to create a new login everytime and if they were able to successfully login pass their information to the invoice. This gave me some insight on how my information is saved when I log in to a website and how hackers are able to access our information if it is not stored properly.</p>
<div>
Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
No, I worked by myself.
<div> 
How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
<p>I had a lot of trouble getting my tostring to pass information from my products page to login/registration and then to invoice. I eventually ended up just creating the form on the server. Another thing I had a problem doing was implementing IR5, I knew i had to somehow get users login to store from the login page into an array on the server and then pass it to the invoice, but I was not sure how. I was able to get help by emailing Professor Kazman or console logging as I worked through the Assignment.</p>
<div>  
How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
<p>Assignment 1 was mostly about being able to "guard" users from inputting invalid information without guards, but Assignment 2 was about validating users information and then passing it along as the user navigates the website.
<div>
Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
<p>i would say about 50& of the time was spent thinking about how to do something, 25% of the time was writing code, and 25% of the time was spent testing and debugging.</p>
<div>  
Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
<p>Validing user information was the easy part for me. What was difficult was getting information to get passed along and what did not work at all was getting my IR5 to work.</p>
<div>  
If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
<p>i would have made the form on the server from the get-go because this would have saved me a tremendous amount of time that I could have spent on IR5.</p>
