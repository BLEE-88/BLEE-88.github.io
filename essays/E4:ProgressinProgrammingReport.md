<div><p>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</p>
<div>
When I look at a problem am I able to make a kind of pseudo-code that solves the problem in my head before I begin writing my program. I am also able to write some code on my own without having to use our labs as a reference. 
</div>
<p>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</p>
<div>
<div>
When working on my code I have trouble putting it together to make it work. I mostly make errors like not matching variables. I also have to use reference when making more complicated blocks of code. 
</div>
  <div>
<p>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</p>
<div>
It depends for me because it takes a little more time to digest the information we learn from class. When working on assignments it feels like things are very fast paced and a little hard to piece together, but by the end of the assignment I should be able to get my code to work.
</div>
    <div>
<p>The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</p>
<div>
When working on labs, I sometimes have trouble understanding what the question is asking. The wording used is a little bit confusing because I am not used to the technical terms yet. I usually go back to the lecture screencast or reference back to the notes that I take during class.
</div>  
      <div>
<p>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</p>
<div>
I personally find Assignment 2 very different from Assignment 1. Assignment 1 feels like a recap of what we had learned during the semester, but Assignment 2 has elements that we have not learned yet. It might be too early to say this though because it has only just been assigned. I do feel more confident going into Assignment 1 than I do for 2 because I have a foundation for my assignment 2.
</div>  
        <div>
<p>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</p>
<div>
I mostly had trouble understanding some of the questions and having to email Professor Kazman for clarification. The class is very fast paced, but I do not think there is a way to work around that because it is all important. 
</div>
          <div>
<p>What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):</p>
<div>
The most helpful thing for me would be the Labs and WODs because we are using our code and producing a visual example. One on one help is also very useful because I can get help putting together my thoughts and arranging my code to get it to work. Some errors are also easier to spot when you have more experience.
