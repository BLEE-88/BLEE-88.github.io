Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)

I created a store that sells items that were handcrafted or representative of a student organization called The Manoa Garden with the goal of self-sustainability. I sold items that were either grown in the garden, created by hand, or made to represent our organization. 
  
Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
The main thing i had trouble with was getting the cart to work. That took me a few days to figure out how to create the cart and store the quantities in the session. Looking back at it now it looks easy, but when starting from nothing it is overwhelming. I was not able to implement an add to favorites button, I get the idea that i have to somehow label the item as a favorite and then post it to the server with designation, but I have no clue how with the new techniques in the code examples like LoadJSON to get it to load into the server.

Describe what you are most proud of about your system:
I am very proud of my cart. It was the most frustrating part of the project and it cost me a lot to get it working. I think that my cart is able to handle quantities and to not allow stranged inputs well. 

Describe what you are least happy with your system:
I am the least happy with how the IR4 turned out. I tried to look through multiple pages of stackoverflow and I could not find even one on creating a cart with favorites. It seems like a feature that is overlooked by other students when they build a shopping cart as a project.
  
How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?
Assignment 2 was very similar to assignment 1, so I had a better idea of what direction to go in. Assignment 3 was very far disconnected from the other 2, it required me to redo my user_data.json file, redesign my products page, and generate multiple items on the server to get everything working.

When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?
I would first attempt to solve the problem on my own or search for a similar problem online to solve it. If I was not able to understand it, then I would email Professor Kazman.

Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?
My cart is the main feature of my store. I managed to create it on the server using different functions and techniques. I also think the layout and display of my pages looks like it would be a solid website with some touch-ups.

Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?
I tried to do IR4 using a checkbox to indicate that the item was a favorite item, but I was not able to get my code to acknowledge that the item was a favorite when creating a session array.
  
What did you learn from doing this assignment?
From a technical standpoint i learned about session, cookies, improved understanding of functions, and loops. From a student standpoint, I learned that I should not be afraid to ask for help when I need it. Meeting with Professor Kazman during office hours helped me voice my concerns better than if I had just simply sent an email. Going forward I will definitely utilize office hours more and get help as soon as i run into something I do not understand rather than letting my problems build up.
  
If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
I would have tried to create a schedule for this class that works with my other classes because I was overwhelmed by all the deadlines, volunteer hours, exams, essays, and presentations that happened at the end of the semester. Coming from having all online classes to all in person was a big shock to me because this was my first in person semester at a 4-year university and it was a good, but painful learning experience.

Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
60% Thinking about how to do something, 20% writing code, and 20% testing and debugging.

Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)
  
I worked on this assignment by myself.
