Starting college I had no idea what I had no idea what I wanted to major in. I had originally chosen Accounting as my major even though I did not know what I would do with that degree. After taking a few courses I realized that I couldn't see myself doing this for the rest of my life. I was going to change my major to Botany, but realized that there are very few jobs in that field. I wanted a major that would get me out of college the fastest and help me start a career that I could pivot towards a job in conservation. I found out about MIS through a friend and did research on the major. I found that you could apply for jobs in data analysis or business analysis with an MIS degree and changed my major.
