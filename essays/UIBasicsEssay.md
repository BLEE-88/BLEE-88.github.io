<p>BrowserHistory1 was about creating sections with information in them. We then had to create links in a table of contents that directed to a corresponding section. Lastly, we attached logos for each section. The new thing that I learned in this WOD was creating lists and linking them to text. Browserhistory2 was about styling our html page using css. Most of the css was straightforward but figuring out how to make the image inline with the text and getting the font to work was what I had trouble with. Browserhistory3 was about re-organizing the sections into columns and adding more css, to make everything fit together.</p>


  
<p>BrowserHistory1 was very similar to the lab that we had worked on previously in class. This made it much easier for me to comprehend what was being asked because I had already done it before. This WOD was more time consuming because it had many steps, such as making multiple headers and linking them to external web pages. The thing that I had trouble with was creating the table of contents. Creating an itemized list for the sections was something foreign to me, so I had to watch the screencast for that.</p>


  
<p>BrowserHistory2 was more confusing because the entire thing was something new. After reading the instructions and trying a little, I kept on getting stuck and having to restart. I had to go back to our readings about google fonts because I couldn’t figure out how we were supposed to get it to Open Sans. When I tried to autofill it in VSCode it kept defaulting to Sans Serif, so I just assumed that they are the same. After watching the screencast things became clearer, but I will have to review BrowserHistory2 when we start working on similar assignments.</p>

  
  
<p>BrowserHistory3 was very abstract, I knew what was expected from the image, but not how I was going to get there. I had to watch the screencast very early on and even after watching it, it still took many tries to get the result I wanted. I found that you could skip the list-style-type step by putting the display inline after trying it a few times. I am not 100% sure how that works, but it did. After completing all three assignments, I have a better understanding of what we are expected to know for our future assignments, but I will not be able to recite this information off the top of my head without more practice.</p>


  
<p>To do better on future WODs, I will go back to the previous labs to get an idea on what it is being asked. For example, Browserhistory3 was very vague on its instructions and required me to watch the screencast and look back on our readings to understand what it was even asking for. I also learned from Professor Kazman that you can inspect the page to debug the errors before you use your other resources. I used this find out that I forgot to put id=”imgbox” in a divider. That’s pretty much all I would do to prepare for WODs, but as we continue doing these I might learn new things.</p>
