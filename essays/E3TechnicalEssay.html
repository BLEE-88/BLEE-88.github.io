<p>Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html">link to this page</a> for further details</p>

<p>Preparing for the WODs in E3: Technical essay was much easier than Browsers one through three because they were very similar to the questions we went over in the labs. The average number of attempts also went down for this set of WODs also went down due to this. The WOD I had the most trouble with was probably invoice2 because there were many repetitive steps that I glossed over because of carelessness. </p>
 
<p>Browserhistory6 was a continuation of the Browserhistory wod group, we changed our navbar into input type buttons and added an onmouseover event that displayed an image of that browser. I had trouble getting the mouseover event to work, but through debugging, I found that I forgot to remove a div. This was the first time I used the browser console to fix code.</p>

<p> SmartPhoneProducts with variables was testing our ability to replace previous information using document.write and setting variables to go with it in a JS file. This was our first time loading and executing javascript from another file. </p>
  
<p> Invoice1 was simple because we set variables that would calculate different totals using basic arithmetic like multiplication and addition. This WOD made it easy for us to miss a step because there were so many variables we had to edit to display what we want. Using document.write to put in our calculated variables required us to use tofixed(2) which rounded our numbers to two variables.</p>

<p>The goal of invoice2 was to use an if, elseif, else statement to create a line in a table that calculates shipping, and then adds it to the table. I would not say it was very difficult because it is exactly like the problem, we did in Lab7. Referring to invoice1, we started adding comments to our code. I think that this is something that Professor Kazman is trying to get us to familiarize ourselves with.</p>

<p>Smartphoneproducts2 was about creating a loop to display the various information in our javascript. We used "i" in increments to display the information for example, name1 would become name2 since we used eval() to turn the strings into the value we want. This one was straight-forward because it was almost the same as our in class lab on loops.</p>

<p>I will stick to my method of preparing for WODs, which is reviewing the lab before attempting it for now. I think my formula works for now, but if I had to do something different, I would try to worry less about the amount of time I take to finish the WODs. I found that I ended up losing points because of errors in my code because I would rush to finish the WOD.</p>
